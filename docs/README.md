**Palettify** is a small library with **ZERO** dependencies that lets you add really cool effects to your images.

It scans the images you provide, extracts their color palette and applies the styles that you have specified. Palettify can apply both static styles (applies once when the scripts is run) and dynamic styles, applied on each interaction (hover, click, drag etc).

**Palettify** also provides a really simple way to use the all the generated colors and palettes, with simple {{moustache}} bindings e.g. `border: '2px solid {{rgb.0}}'` 0 meaning the first and primary color in the palette.
